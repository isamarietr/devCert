    "# Welcome to Session 3: Indexes and Aggregations\n",
    "## Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last session we talked in depth about `MQL`, Mongo Query Language, which is the primary way to perform reads, writes, updates, etc, against data in MongoDB. However, there is sometimes a requirement to read data (or manipulate data) in more advanced ways than `MQL`\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, MongoDB has another query syntax called the `Aggregation Framework`. It generally follows the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`db.collection.aggregate([aggregation_stages])`\n",
    "\n",
    "As an argument, the `aggregate` accepts an array of `stages`. The output of 1 stage becomes the input to the next stage, so a developer is able to massage the data in unique ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the aggregation stage is no stage can have more than 100mb of data (allowDiskUse to get around this)\n",
    "\n",
    "**similar to how knowing / remembering query operators, it is important on the test to have a level of knowledge regarding the most common stages**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some basic aggregations, then we can do a deeper dive into the specific stages"

Ethan, a practical older brother, and adorable Hallie, who knows how to charm her way out of a difficult situation, are intent on spending Christmas with their parents, Catherine and Micheal, and grandmother Lillian. As Ethan and Hallie embark on their adventure, almost nothing goes exactly as they planned. Complicating things is a smarmy businessman named Toney Boer, who has taken an interest in Catherine. Ethan, meanwhile, is preoccupied with not only his parents' romantic dilemma, but also his own - one brought about by his new friendship with Stephanie, his first teenage crush. What evolves is an elaborate scheme involving mice, telephone calls and an ice-cream truck, as Ethan and Hallie try to achieve their goal with the help of Stephanie. The duo's primary obstacle is their mother's fiance, Tony. The children finally succeed with a little Christmas magic from Santa Claus.`\u001b[39m,\n",

Ethan, a practical older brother, and adorable Hallie, who knows how to charm her way out of a difficult situation, are intent on spending Christmas with their parents, Catherine and Micheal, and grandmother Lillian. As Ethan and Hallie embark on their adventure, almost nothing goes exactly as they planned. Complicating things is a smarmy businessman named Toney Boer, who has taken an interest in Catherine. Ethan, meanwhile, is preoccupied with not only his parents' romantic dilemma, but also his own - one brought about by his new friendship with Stephanie, his first teenage crush. What evolves is an elaborate scheme involving mice, telephone calls and an ice-cream truck, as Ethan and Hallie try to achieve their goal with the help of Stephanie. The duo's primary obstacle is their mother's fiance, Tony. The children finally succeed with a little Christmas magic from Santa Claus.`\u001b[39m,\n",

The film portrays the harsh existence of the homeless as Alex, Michele and Hans, an older vagrant survive on the streets with their wits. As they both slowly get their lives back together, Michele becomes increasingly dependent on Alex as her vision deteriorates further. Fearing that Michele will leave him if she receives a new medical treatment Alex attempts to keep Michele practically a prisoner. The streets, skies and waterways of Paris are used as a backdrop to the story in a series of stunning visuals which dominate the film.\"\u001b[39m,\n",

    "As previously mentioned, the aggregation framework accepts as an arugment an array of `stages`. There are many types of stages, which all have their own associated use and syntax. Memorizing / knowing some of the most common stages is very important to being a certified MongoDB developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `$match`: Basically the same as a standard MQL query\n",
    "- `$project`: Similar to a standard MQL projection\n",
    "- `$limit`: limiting the results of a stage\n",
    "- `$out`: Persisting the results of an aggregation to another collection\n",
    "- `$lookup`: Similar to a SQL Join, incorporating data from another collection in the aggregation\n",
    "- `$set`: for modifying documents within an aggregation query\n",
    "- `$unwind`: to manipulate array values\n",
    "- `$group`: to group and create averages, summaries, etc\n",
    "- `$search`: To use a MongoDB Atlas Search index to perform a lucene based search. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the aggregation framework allows a developer to access data within a document by using `$` syntax\n",
    "- there are a lot of stages. Although the above list covers most of them, I encourage you to [check them all out here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/)\n",

    "... Okay... \n",

    "**IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU MEMORIZE THE CONTENT FROM THIS SESSION AND THE PAST SESSION. WHILE INDEXES ARE IMPORTANT FOR A MONGODB DEVELOPER, KNOWLEDGE OF MQL AND AGGREGATIONS MAKE UP 50% OF THE TEST'S CONTENT.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For any real use of MongoDB, it is required to make an index to support the most common queries. Before talking about MongoDB indexes, I will spend a bit discussing how the MongoDB server process _works_\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU: Coordinates query parsing and query handling\n",
    "- RAM: contains indexes and data that is being \"examined\", as well as handling connections, managing transactions, cursors\n",
    "- SSD / \"storage\" / \"disk\": stores all data files\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the server receives a query of a new \"shape' (the inputs in the query), a background server process will determine the best index to use and store the \"query plan\" in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents need to be examined - the process of checking fields to see if they match the filter that is passed into the query. MongoDB does not have the ability to \"examine\" documents while they are in disk. Thus, all documents that _may_ satisfy the query will be \"fetched\" from disk into memory. An index allows the database to store fields in memory, and by using indexes we can avoid fetching many documents from disk to RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should point out that fetching large amounts of documents from disk to RAM is a very slow operation that highly taxes available computer resources. It is beyond the scope of these sessions, but generally we should avoid large \"scans\"\n",
    "\n",
    "... Okay...\n",
    "\n",
    "That's enough of the theoretical stuff for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some facts:\n",
    "- Indexes are defined at the collection level\n",
    "- Indexes can be created on individual fields, or multiple fields\n",
    "- For multiple field (\"compound\") indexes, the ordering matters\n",
    "- The _id field is always indexed\n",
    "- Indexes can be used to enforce uniqueness\n",
    "- administrative commands for creating indexes and removing indexes are not a focus for the developer exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to reason about indexes is to reason about them like a phone book. We will talk about this soon.\n",

    "### Compound Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "The most complex queries and the most performant application requirements typically take advantage of indexes on multiple fields, called \"compound indexes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to think about a compound index is like a phonebook. Or, more like a phonebook is essentially indexed on `{lastName:1,firstName:1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Phonebook](./_images/3/phonebook.png)"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "{last_name:1,first_name:1,address:1}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about questions that we can efficiently answer with this phonebook is a great metaphor for use of compound indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions this book could easily answer:\n",
    "- What is Paul Bates's address and telephone number? `db.people.find({lastName:\"Bates\",firstName:\"Paul\"})`\n",
    "- How many Bates are there? `db.people.countDocuments({lastName:\"Bates\"})`\n",
    "- Organize (sort) all the Bates by first name. `db.people.find({lastName:\"Bates\"}).sort({firstName:1})`\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions that would be challenging:\n",
    "- what is the number of the person who lives on 119 Willow Road? `db.people.find({addr:\"119 Willow Rd\"})`\n",
    "- How many Charlottes are there? `db.people.countDocuments({firstName:\"Charlotte\"})`\n",
    "- Sort this phonebook by first name, not last name `db.people.find().sort({firstName:1})`\n",
    "\n",
    "This metaphor illustrates a concept called the **Index Prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, for compound indexes, you can cover sorts and searches that take advantages of all fields moving from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the index `{a:1,b:1,c:1}`, we could cover:\n",
    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\"})`\n",
    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\"}).sort({b:1})`\n",
    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\"}).sort({b:1,c:1})` <-- compound sort\n",
    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\",b:\"example\"})`\n",
    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\",b:\"example\"}).sort({b:1})`\n",
    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\",b:\"example\"}).sort({c:1})`\n",

    "- `db.collection.find({a:\"example\",b:\"example\",c:\"example\"})`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we assume equality matches for the above examples. Range queries don't follow the same rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESR rule of thumb: It is generally a better index strategy to index fields in the order of equality, sort, range.\n",
    "\n",
    "compound sorts must follow the same relative directions as the index. For example with the same `abc` index, we could cover sorts on `{a:1,b:1,c:1}` or `{a:-1,b:-1,c:-1}` but **not** `{a:1,b:-1,c:1}` for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implication of index prefixes is that indexes can be redundant. For example, given a collection with an index on `{a:1,b:1,c:1}`, the index `{a:1,b:1}` provides no value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Indexes + Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything that we have discussed so far has been a feature of the core MongoDB server (mongod). However, There is one part of the Developer Exam that is only applicable to Atlas, the MongoDB DBaaS. That is Atlas Search Indexes. **These are seperate from the MongoDB indexes we have been discussing**. These indexes are hosted on a Lucene process outside of of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to define indexes is the via the Atlas UI or API, and the index definition is completely different from the syntax as shown previously in this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to configure a search index, one must use the Atlas UI, or Atlas admin API, or the MongoDB drivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the index definition has the following form:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ \n",
    "  \"name\": \"<index-name>\", \n",
    "  \"analyzer\": \"<analyzer-for-index>\", \n",
    "  \"searchAnalyzer\": \"<analyzer-for-query>\", \n",
    "  \"mappings\": { \n",
    "    \"dynamic\": <boolean>, \n",
    "    \"fields\": { <field-definition> } \n",
    "  }, \n",
    "  \"analyzers\": [ <custom-analyzer> ],\n",
    "  \"storedSource\": <boolean> | {\n",
    "    <stored-source-definition>\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"synonyms\": [\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  ] \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although some of these configurations are outside the scope of the session, giving a search index a name, analyzer and mappings might come up on the developer exam. How do we _use_ this index? I won't make you wait for the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the aggregation framework. Specifically the `$search` stage. Let's take a look (using an index called \"default\"):"

When she does find him, to her horror she sees that he has joined a terrorist group. She forces him to come home, and he finally re-unites with their mother (played by Jaya Bachchan). However his allegiance and thoughts make him want to join the terrorist network, led by Murad Khan (Manoj Bajpai). A confrontation with two men who harass Fiza leads to Aman revealing his involvement with the terrorist network in front of his sister, mother and the police. His mother's grief and disappointment eventually lead her to commit suicide. Fiza tries once more to find her brother, with the help of Anirudh (Bikram Saluja). Aman has been sent on a mission to kill two powerful politicians; when he does succeed in assassinating them, his own terrorist group tries to kill him. He escapes and Fiza follows him. They confront each other and with the police closing in on him, he asks her to kill him. After much persuasion Fiza kills her brother.

There's a searing pain in his gut that he can't tolerate and a dazed quietness to his struggle as he tries to maintain his equilibrium. Wilson is attempting to move on from the sudden and inexplicable suicide of his wife. His mother-in-law is there for him, but her sympathies turn quickly. He has an employer that seems to want to help him, and a workmate who wants him for herself. But nothing and no one can give Wilson solace; so, he seeks oblivion. It is not the usual alcohol or drugs. Wilson inhales fumes from gasoline cans and model airplane fuel and finds temporary salvation in the company of remote-control model enthusiasts. However, nothing that provides him relief really lasts.\"\u001b[39m,\n",
