    "## MQL\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already met MQL, we just didn't call it by that name. *MQL* is short for \"MongoDB Query Language,\" and is the standard way to interface against the MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a certification test, rarely will the term MQL be used. The questions are usually asked \"What is the proper syntax to query using X field?\" and the options are various types of MQL. The term \"MQL\" is an umbrella term that references a standard query syntax across the mongo shell (mongosh), drivers, the Compass GUI, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last session we finished with using MQL to insert() documents. Now, let's actually read some of the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reads\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, to perform a read using MQL, the syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`db.findOne({filter},{projection})` <-- this returns a document\n",
    "\n",
    "`db.find({filter},{projection})` <-- this returns multiple documents... or really a *cursor* \n",
    "\n",
    "A cursor is a pointer to the results of a query in memory. The client then iterates through the cursor. Its important to note that the shell automatically iterates through the first 20 documents in a cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a shell helper function, `.toArray()` which will take the all of documents in the cursor and creat an array out of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is that `{filter}` thing? Well, that's going to take up most of this session. Generally, it is a BSON object that represents the inputs to your query. By default, the MongoDB Server returns all fields of a document. For the RDBMS people out there, it is like doing a SQL `SELECT *`. The `{projection}` object is a way to determine which fields are returned by a query. Let's take a look at some examples:"

Ethan, a practical older brother, and adorable Hallie, who knows how to charm her way out of a difficult situation, are intent on spending Christmas with their parents, Catherine and Micheal, and grandmother Lillian. As Ethan and Hallie embark on their adventure, almost nothing goes exactly as they planned. Complicating things is a smarmy businessman named Toney Boer, who has taken an interest in Catherine. Ethan, meanwhile, is preoccupied with not only his parents' romantic dilemma, but also his own - one brought about by his new friendship with Stephanie, his first teenage crush. What evolves is an elaborate scheme involving mice, telephone calls and an ice-cream truck, as Ethan and Hallie try to achieve their goal with the help of Stephanie. The duo's primary obstacle is their mother's fiance, Tony. The children finally succeed with a little Christmas magic from Santa Claus.`\u001b[39m,\n",

    "- If multiple `{key:value}` pairs are passed into the `filter`, the behavior is a boolean `and`. \n",
    "- There are *[operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/)* that enhance functionality of MQL. **It is imperative to know what most of the operators do to be a MongoDB certified developer**\n",
    "- The way to do a boolean `or` is via the operator  `{$or:[]}`\n",
    " \n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As I just mentioned, knowing operators are important. Here is a non comprehensive list of operators:\n",
    "- `eq` - \"equal\": it is similar to a normal query\n",
    "- `$gt/$gte/$lt/$lte` - greater [and equal] / less than [and equal]: important operator for range queries\n",
    "- `{$in:[]} / {$nin:[]}` - in or not in: multiple value equality match\n",
    "- `$ne` - \"not equal\"\n",
    "- `$not`: inverses the logic of a query\n",
    "- `$or`: performs a boolean or\n",
    "- `$and`: performs a boolean and. usually used for [specific nesting situations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/and/#and-queries-with-multiple-expressions-specifying-the-same-operator)\n",
    "- `$exists`: filters based on key existence\n",
    "- `$type`: filters based on BSON type\n",
    "- `$elemMatch`: intended for querying on objects within arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE: Jupyer interprets** `$` **as a special character. so in the examples below I add a backslash before all instances of the dollar sign. We then print the query string without the backslash to help avoid confusion**\n",
