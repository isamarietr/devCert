    "## MongoDB Architecture & Atlas\n",
    "For the sake of getting MongoDB certified, MongoDB Architecture is not a major focus, but it helps to have a basic understanding. Also, it's hard to develop anything on MongoDB if you don't have a database to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is an easy way to get access to a MongoDB database for free. That is by creating a free tier cluster in our managed service called Atlas. We will discuss logging in and creating an organization and project in the session, but generally it can be found at [here](https://cloud.mongodb.com) Once a cluster is created, whitelist the source IP address (either this host or your local host), create a database user, and you are ready to use MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atlas also has some sample data sets that we will use in these sessions, so please upload that data set. \n",
